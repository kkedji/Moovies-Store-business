Answering business questions from multiples tables of a Moovies business store.

This project focuses on leveraging SQL skills to extract and analyze data from a Movies Database for a Movies Rental Business. The goal is to provide comprehensive insights and answer key questions related to the business's operations, inventory, customers, and performance.

Project Overview
The project aims to address the following questions and provide data-driven solutions:

Identifying store managers and store locations: Retrieve the names of managers and the full addresses of each store to facilitate in-person introductions.

Analyzing inventory: Generate a detailed inventory list, including store ID, inventory ID, film names, ratings, rental rates, and replacement costs. This information helps potential acquirers understand the stock available for rental.

Inventory overview: Provide a summary-level overview of the inventory, including the count of inventory items with each rating at each store. This overview allows an understanding of the distribution of movies across different ratings.

Evaluating inventory diversification: Assess the diversification of inventory by examining the impact of film category popularity on different stores. Calculate the number of films, average replacement cost, and total replacement cost by store and film category.

Customer analysis: Obtain a comprehensive list of customers, including their names, store preferences, active status, and complete addresses. This data aids in understanding the customer base and their geographic distribution.

Customer spending and lifetime value: Analyze customer spending patterns by compiling a list of customer names, total lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments collected from them. This information helps identify the most valuable customers based on their lifetime value.

Board of advisors and investors: Compile a list of advisors and investors involved with the business, noting their roles and affiliations. This information provides insights into the business's support network and potential partnerships.

Coverage of most awarded actors: Evaluate the presence of films featuring actors with different numbers of awards to assess the business's coverage of highly acclaimed actors.
